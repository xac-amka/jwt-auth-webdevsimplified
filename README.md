# JWT Authentication 

JSON web tokens are one of the more popular ways to secure applications, especially in micro-services, but JWT is much more complex than a simple session based user authentication. In this video I will be breaking down exactly how to set up authentication with JWT and how to ensure the authentication is secure. I will also be showing how to setup refresh tokens with JWT so that your application is even more resilient and secure. Lastly, I will show how to invalidate refresh tokens which is the ultimate last step in securing an application.
